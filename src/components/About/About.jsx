          I'm a MERN stack developer with a strong interest in building
          full-stack web applications that are both scalable and user-friendly.
          I enjoy working with modern technologies like React, Node.js, Express,
          and MongoDB (using Mongoose), and I'm comfortable handling both
          front-end and back-end development. I've also been learning and
          applying TypeScript to write cleaner and more reliable code, and Iâ€™ve
          worked with PostgreSQL when projects call for relational databases.
          During my university studies, I completed courses in C, C++, Java, and
          C#, which helped me build a solid foundation in programming and
          problem-solving. I'm always looking to improve my skills, explore new
          technologies, and create meaningful digital experiences through code.
